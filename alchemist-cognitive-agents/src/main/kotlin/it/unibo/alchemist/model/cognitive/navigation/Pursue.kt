/**
 * A [NavigationStrategy] allowing to pursue a known (static) [destination] without knowing any
 * path leading there, this is also known as path searching.
 * In this context, knowing a destination means knowing its position, which, in turn, means
 * knowing two things:
 * - the direction that connects the destination and the current position as the crow flies,
 * - an estimation of the distance between the destination and the current position.
 * In order to reach the [destination] without a route to follow, the weighting system used
 * in [Explore] is extended so as to take into account the (estimated) suitability of each
 * door to reach the provided [destination], see [suitabilityFactor].
 *
 * @param T the concentration type.
 * @param L the type of landmarks of the pedestrian's cognitive map.
 * @param R the type of edges of the pedestrian's cognitive map, representing the [R]elations between landmarks.
