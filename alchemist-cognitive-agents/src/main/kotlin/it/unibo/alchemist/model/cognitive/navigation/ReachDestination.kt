/**
 * A [NavigationStrategy] allowing to reach a (static) destination.
 * The client can specify a list of [knownDestinations] (see [Pursue]) and [unknownDestinations] (see
 * [GoalOrientedExploration]).
 * The pedestrian will try to reach the closest known destination for which a valid path leading there is
 * known, but in case another destination is found along the way (either known or unknown), the latter will
 * be approached instead of the chosen known destination. To put it in another way, this behavior mixes
 * [ReachKnownDestination] and [GoalOrientedExploration].
 *
 * @param T the concentration type.
 * @param L the type of landmarks of the pedestrian's cognitive map.
 * @param R the type of edges of the pedestrian's cognitive map, representing the [R]elations between landmarks.
