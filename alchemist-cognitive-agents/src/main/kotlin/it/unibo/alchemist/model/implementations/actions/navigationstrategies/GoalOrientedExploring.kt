/**
 * A [NavigationStrategy] allowing to explore the environment looking for something specific whose position
 * is unknown.
 * The client can specify a list of [unknownDestinations]: these can be recognized once they're in sight,
 * but the node doesn't know their position until that moment (think e.g. of exits in an evacuation
 * scenario). More specifically, unknown destinations can be detected if located in a room adjacent to the
 * room the node is into. Once a destination is detected, the node will reach it and stop.
 *
 * @param T the concentration type.
 * @param L the type of landmarks of the node's cognitive map.
 * @param R the type of edges of the node's cognitive map, representing the [R]elations between landmarks.
