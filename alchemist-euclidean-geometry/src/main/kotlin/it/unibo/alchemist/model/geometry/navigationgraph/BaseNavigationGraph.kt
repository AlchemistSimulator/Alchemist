/**
 * An implementation of [NavigationGraph], deriving from [AbstractBaseGraph].
 * The user can specify the [GraphType] so as to obtain a custom graph (e.g. weighted or not,
 * directed or undirected, etc). [AbstractBaseGraph] guarantees deterministic ordering for
 * the collection it maintains, as stated in its api documentation.
 * Note that vertices and edges are used as keys inside [AbstractBaseGraph], so when choosing
 * their types, you must follow these rules:
 * - You must follow the contract defined in java.lang.Object for both equals and hashCode.
 * - In particular, if you override either equals or hashCode, you must override them both.
 * - Your implementation for hashCode must produce a value which does not change over the
 * lifetime of the object.
 * Further information available [here](https://jgrapht.org/guide/VertexAndEdgeTypes).
