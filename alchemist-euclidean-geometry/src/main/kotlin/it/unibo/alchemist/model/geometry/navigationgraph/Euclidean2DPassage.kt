/**
 * Defines a passage between two [ConvexPolygon]s in an euclidean bidimensional space. The passage is oriented, which
 * means it connects [tail] to [head], but the opposite is not necessarily true. [tail] and [head] can be non-adjacent
 * (there can be some distance between them), this introduces navigation issues as agents may not know which direction
 * to follow when crossing a passage. [passageShapeOnTail] is a [Segment2D] representing the shape of the passage on
 * [tail]'s boundary (e.g. in indoor environments, the segment should represent the shape of the door between two
 * rooms). [passageShapeOnTail] must be determined so as to guarantee that [head] is reachable by throwing a ray from
 * any point of the segment in its normal direction. This solves navigation issues as it provides agents with a
 * direction to follow when crossing [Euclidean2DPassage]s (namely, the normal direction to [passageShapeOnTail]).
