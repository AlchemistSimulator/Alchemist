 * environment which are traversable by agents (the advantage of such representation is that agents can freely
 * walk around within a convex area, as it is guaranteed that no obstacle will be found).
 * Note that implementations of this graph must guarantee predictable ordering for the collections they maintain,
 * as reproducibility is a key feature of Alchemist.
 * Be also aware that, by contract, the [org.jgrapht.Graph] interface does not allow duplicated edges (see
 * [org.jgrapht.Graph.addEdge]).

 * A [NavigationGraph] in an euclidean bidimensional space. Nodes are [ConvexPolygon]s and edges are
 * [Euclidean2DPassage]s. Using [Euclidean2DPassage]s as edges leads to some overhead (as these store the nodes they
 * connect, when this information is already stored in the navigation graph), but allows to have duplicate edges in
 * opposite directions, which means a node n1 can be connected to another node n2 through a passage whose shape is
 * equal to the one of the passage connecting n2 to n1. The two passages would not result equal because their tail
 * and head would be swapped. On the contrary, if edges were plain segments, the graph would not have allowed to have
 * two edges so that e1.equal(e2).
