/**
 * A [Predicate] that [tests][test] if an environment's
 * nodes (meaning their position and concentration) have
 * remained unchanged for a certain amount of steps.
 *
 * The check isn't performed on every [step][it.unibo.alchemist.core.Simulation.getStep]
 * of a [simulation][it.unibo.alchemist.core.Simulation],
 * instead an interval that determines how many steps are
 * to be skipped between each check is specified.
 * For [test] to return true, an environment must remain unchanged for
 * `checkInterval * equalIntervals` steps. This result might not be
 * entirely consistent, since the check isn't performed every step so
 * as not to cause performance issues. Therefore it might happen that
 * some changes occur in the environment but are reverted before the
 * next check is performed.
 *
 * [test] should be called at every step of the simulation in order
 * to avoid missing checks.
 *
 * @constructor Creates a new [StableForSteps] with the given values.
 *
 * @param checkInterval The recurrence of the test
 * @param equalIntervals The amount of [checkInterval] intervals that need to pass
 * (during which the environment doesn't change) for [test] to return true
