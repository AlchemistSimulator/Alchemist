/**
 * A special TimeDistribution that schedules the reaction after [start],
 * according to the value of a [molecule] which contains the delta time.
 * If a [property] is specified, the value to be interpreted as time delta is read from the [incarnation].
 * Otherwise, the [node] is accessed directly for reading the value.
 *
 * It's possible to associate an [errorDistribution] to this time distribution, whose samples will be used
 * to shift the time samples.
 *
 * There are some conditions to be satisfied:
 * - [molecule] must be modified exclusively by the reaction being scheduled
 * - [molecule] must exist in the node. If it does not and the environment returns null, it is assumed to be zero
 * - [molecule] must have a positive or zero value associated.
 * - [molecule]'s concentration must have a type which is understandable as a positive number
 *   ([Number], [Time], or a parse-able [String]).
 * - the [errorDistribution]'s samples plus the value of the [molecule] concentration (or property value)
 *   **must** always be greater than zero. It is thus recommended to use an [errorDistribution] whose
 *   support lower bound is zero or greater
