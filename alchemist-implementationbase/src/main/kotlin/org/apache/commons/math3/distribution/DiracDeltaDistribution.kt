/**
 * Models a Real Distribution backed by a Dirac Delta Function.
 * This is similar to a Logistic probability function with a shape whose value tends to zero.
 *
 * In practice, samples from this function return the provided [value] as a constant.
 * The variance is zero, there is no randomness involved, and most of the useful information of a real distribution
 * are actually lost.
 * However, this utility can transform tools meant to work with a probability function in such a way that
 * they work with a constant value (e.g., random walks with a constant step).
