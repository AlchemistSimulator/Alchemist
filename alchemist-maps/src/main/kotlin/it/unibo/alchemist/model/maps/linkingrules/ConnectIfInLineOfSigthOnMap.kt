/**
 * This rule connects nodes that are within [maxRange] distance, but only if there are not too many obstacles
 * separating their line of sight.
 * The base idea is that line-of-sight distance and routing distance should not differ "too much",
 * as captured by [tolerance].
 * [tolerance] measures the maximum allowed relative difference between the line-of-sight and the route distance.
 * It's default 0.1 (10%) means that if LOS-distance is more than 10% shorter than route-distance, then the nodes are
 * considered disconnected.
 * Route distance is taken two-ways (to account for one-way roads) and the shortest one is considered
 * (wireless signals do not need to follow one-way roads).
