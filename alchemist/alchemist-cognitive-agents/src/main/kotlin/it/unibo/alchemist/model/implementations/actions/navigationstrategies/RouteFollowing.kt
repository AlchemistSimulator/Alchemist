/**
 * A [NavigationStrategy] allowing to follow a given [route].
 * The [route] consists of a list of positions (= waypoints) that may or may not be in sight of each
 * other (i.e. the path leading from a waypoint to the next one may or may not be representable
 * as a single segment), for this reason [Pursuing] behavior is used to reach each waypoint.
 * In this context, a waypoint is considered reached when it's inside the current room (not when the
 * pedestrian reach that exact position), apart from the last waypoint which is actually approached.
 * Cuts to the route are allowed (i.e. if the pedestrian finds a waypoint which is farther than the
 * expected next one, he/she skips all the waypoints in between).
 *
 * @param T the concentration type.
 * @param L the type of landmarks of the pedestrian's cognitive map.
 * @param R the type of edges of the pedestrian's cognitive map.
