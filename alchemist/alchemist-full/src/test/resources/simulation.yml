    # Writing Protelis programs within a YAML file is a bad experience
    # (some characters need escaping, no syntax highlight, no code suggestions...)
    # We recommend using the Protelis Eclipse plugin to write your code, then
    # Loading the code as a module within Alchemist
    # In order to run this example, make sure that src/main/protelis is part of
    # your classpath (the Gradle script is already properly configured).
