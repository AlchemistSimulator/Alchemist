/**
 * A passage between two [ConvexPolygon]s in an euclidean bidimensional space.
 * The passage is oriented, which means it connects [tail] to [head], but the opposite is
 * not necessarily true.
 * [tail] and [head] can be non-adjacent (there can be some distance between them), this
 * introduces navigation issues as agents may not know which direction to follow when
 * crossing a passage.
 * [passageShapeOnTail] is a [Segment2D] representing the shape of the passage on [tail]'s
 * boundary (e.g. in an indoor environment, the segment should represent the shape of the
 * door between two rooms). [passageShapeOnTail] must be determined so as to guarantee that
 * [head] is reachable by throwing a ray from any point of the segment in its normal direction.
 * This solves navigation issues as it provides agents with a direction to follow when crossing
 * [Euclidean2DPassage]s (namely, the normal direction to [passageShapeOnTail]).
