          # This tells the simulator to share the results of the last computation. No time distribution has ``as soon as possible'' semantics (Markovian event with inifinite rate). The separation is useful in case the user wants to simulate a delay between the computation and the delivery of messages, e.g. to simulate network delays, or a battery saving policy on the wireless modules.
