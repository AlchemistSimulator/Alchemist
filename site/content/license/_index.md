### Legal information

# The Alchemist Simulator License

{{% notice info "Explanation for humans" %}}
Alchemist adopts a GNU GPLv3 license with a permissive modification.
Alchemist or parts of it *can be used in commercial products* and closed-source software components,
as far as they are *not mutated*.
Namely, the GPLv3 is extended with a *linking/classpath exception*,
so it can be used freely as a library, but
modified versions the software must instead be released with a GPLv3 compatible lincesing scheme.
There is no requirement for the portion of the program calling Alchemist to be reverse-engineerable
(the Alchemist license is *more permissive* than GNU LGPL).
If you use the simulator for academic purposes, then you must refer the appropriate paper.
