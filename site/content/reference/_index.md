    Reference guides are technical, austere, and to the point descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it.
    Reference guides have one job only: to describe.
    They are code-determined, because ultimately thatâ€™s what they describe: key classes, functions, APIs,
    and so they list things like functions, fields, attributes and methods, and set out how to use them.
