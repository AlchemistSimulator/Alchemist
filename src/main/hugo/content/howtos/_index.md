    How-to guides take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem.
    They are recipes, directions to achieve a specific end:
    while a tutorial is what a beginner needs to know,
    a how-to guide is an answer to a question that only a user with some experience could even formulate.
    In how-to guides, we assume some knowledge and understanding,
    we assume that the user already knows how to do basic things and use basic tools.
