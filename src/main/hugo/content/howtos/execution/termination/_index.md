Alchemist supports the possibility to write termination conditions for any simulation.
Termination conditions are checked after every event, and, if met, cause the immediate termination of a simulation.
Termination conditions are expected to be found in the {{ anchor('it.unibo.alchemist.model.implementations.terminators') }} package.

They are defined in the [`terminate`](/reference/yaml/#terminate) section of the configuration file.
Multiple terminators are allowed, the first terminator matching causes the termination of the simulation (they are in and).

## Terminating the simulation after some time

One of the simplest terminators availables allows for declaring a simulation completed when a certain simulated time is reached.
In the following example, it is used in conjunction with a number of variables, showing how it's possible to use such
variables to produce batches of simulations terminating at different times.

## Terminating the simulation if the environment is not changing

A terminator is provided for terminating when a simulation is "stable"
(nothing changes in terms of positions and nodes' content).
The class implementing it is {{% api package="model.implementations.terminators" class="StableForSteps" %}}.
