One common way to deploy nodes in a bidimensional space is on a grid.
Grid-like deployments can be easily performed in Alchemist
leveraging the {{% api package="loader.deployments" class="Grid" %}} {{% api package="loader" class="Deployment" %}}.

The following example shows a grid centered in `(0, 0)`,
with nodes distanced of `0.25` both horizontally and vertically.

Often, symmetric structures may induce corner behaviors in self-organising systems,
and real-world "grid" deployments are not usually geometrically perfect.
Indeed, it is common to *perturb* the grid shape randomly,
in order to account for potential irregularities of the real-world system
being simulated.
{{% api package="loader.deployments" class="Grid" %}} supports perturbation natively:
for instance, here is an example of a grid where positions are
randomly perturbed of Â±0.1 distance units.
