[Protelis](https://protelis.org),
from the Latin word figuratively meaning "regarding a team",
is a language targeting the aggregate of devices rather than the single one.
It has been developed on the solid foundation of [Field Calculus](https://doi.org/10.1145/3285956),
a theoretical model of aggregate programming,
and it is written and interoperable with Java.

### Learning Protelis
The language and all the machinery of Protelis are out of the scope of this tutorial.
However, we warmly recommend to read [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/2695664.2695913) first,
and then to deepen your knowledge of Protelis by reading the resources available in
[the official Protelis website](https://protelis.org).

A tutorial similar to the [base tutorial](../basics),
with increasingly rich examples and focused on the Protelis incarnation
can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/AlchemistSimulator/Protelis-Incarnation-tutorial).
The `README.md` file of the project explains the use and the steps to follow.
