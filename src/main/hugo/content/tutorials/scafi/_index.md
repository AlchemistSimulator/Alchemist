ScaFi (Scala Fields) is a Scala-based library and framework for Aggregate Programming.
It implements a variant of the Higher-Order Field Calculus (HOFC) operational semantics,
which is made available as a usable domain-specific language (DSL),
and provides a platform and API for simulating and executing Aggregate Computing systems and applications.

## How to use ScaFi with Alchemist
For more details about ScaFi please read the
documentation in the [official site](https://scafi.github.io/docs/)
where you can find a description of how to integrate ScaFi toolkit
with Alchemist.

A tutorial similar to the [base tutorial](../basics), with increasingly rich examples,
focused on the Scafi incarnation.

The tutorial can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/scafi/learning-scafi-alchemist).
The `README.md` file of the project explains the use and the steps to follow.
