ScaFi (Scala Fields) is a Scala-based library and framework for Aggregate Programming.
It implements a variant of the Higher-Order Field Calculus (HOFC) operational semantics,
which is made available as a usable domain-specific language (DSL),
and provides a platform and API for simulating and executing Aggregate Computing systems and applications.

## How to use ScaFi with Alchemist
For more details about ScaFi please read the 
documentation in the [official site](https://scafi.github.io/docs/)
where you can find a description of how to integrate ScaFi toolkit
with Alchemist. Furthermore, the following two repositories are a great resource to experiment
rapidly with both:
* [Alchemist examples with ScaFi and Protelis](https://bitbucket.org/gaudrito/alchemist-example/src/master/)
* [Alchemist integration with ScaFi](https://github.com/scafi/learning-scafi-alchemist)
