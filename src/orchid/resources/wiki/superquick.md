title: SUPER-QUICK Start

---

You need:
* A terminal, bash compatible preferred
* [Java 11+](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) installed and working
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed and working

Open the terminal and follow these steps
1. `git clone https://github.com/AlchemistSimulator/alchemist-primer `
2. `cd alchemist-primer`
3. Launch depending on your terminal:
  * Bash compatible (Linux, MacOS X, Git Bash, Cygwin): `./gradlew runAll`
  * Windows native (cmd.exe, Powershell): `gradlew.bat runAll`
4. Wait for the simulator components to be downloaded (about five minutes on a reasonable connection)
5. A GUI pops up
6. Press the `P` button to start the simlation. Other relevant buttons are described [here](use/default-gui)

Something went **wrong** along the line?
[Open an issue](https://github.com/AlchemistSimulator/Alchemist/issues/new/choose) and we'll get back to you.

Too quick, works but you wonder why?
[Take your time with the docs](simulator/metamodel), so that maybe you also understand what's going on.
