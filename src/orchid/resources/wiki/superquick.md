title: SUPER-QUICK Start

---

(yes we do assume you have a Bash compatible shell).

* `git clone https://github.com/AlchemistSimulator/alchemist-primer `
* `cd alchemist-primer`
* `./gradlew runAll`
* (see? there is stuff being downloaded)
* A GUI pops up
* Press the `P` button to start the simlation
* [Other relevant buttons](use/swing-gui)

Something went wrong? [Open an issue](https://github.com/AlchemistSimulator/Alchemist/issues/new/choose).

Too quick?
[Take your time with the docs](simulator/metamodel), so that maybe you also understand what's going on.

You can either follow these instructions or those on the `README.md` file of the linked project, information is equivalent.
